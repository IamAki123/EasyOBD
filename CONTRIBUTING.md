Using EasyOBJD on a robot? Start at the [README](README.md), not this page.

## Build and test

You need **JDK 17+** and an **Android SDK**. GitHub Actions and JitPack use JDK 17; the library bytecode is Java 8. Android Gradle Plugin 8.7 will not run on a Java 8 `JAVA_HOME` (a common default on Windows). Point `JAVA_HOME` at Temurin 17 or Android Studio’s JBR, and set `ANDROID_HOME` (or `local.properties` `sdk.dir`) to your SDK.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IamAki123/EasyOBJD.git
cd EasyOBJD
./gradlew test
./gradlew build
```

On Windows use `gradlew.bat`. Android SDK is required because this is an Android library module; Android Studio's Embedded JDK and SDK are enough.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch from `main`.
3. Change the code. If you fix a bug, add a regression test.
4. Run `./gradlew test`.
5. Open a pull request. Describe what changed and why.

Public API changes should include Javadoc and a note in [docs/API.md](docs/API.md). Localization math should include a unit test with a known geometry (see `LocalizationMathTest` and `SampleValuesTest` / `KnownGeometries`) and a short note in [docs/Math.md](docs/Math.md) if the formula changed. If you change sample defaults (`EasyOBJDUserConfig` / Calibrate 31 in), update `KnownGeometries`.

Copy-in samples under [`samples/`](samples/) are **not** in the JitPack AAR. If you change them, update [docs/SampleOpMode.md](docs/SampleOpMode.md) and [docs/Tuning.md](docs/Tuning.md).

## Bugs

Use the bug report template. Include EasyOBJD version, FTC SDK version, camera/HSV setup, and telemetry (cluster X/Y, localization method, process ms).
